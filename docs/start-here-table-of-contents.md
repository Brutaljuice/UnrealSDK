### Welcome to the SpatialOS Unreal SDK documentation

**New to the platform?** You can read [what SpatialOS is (SpatialOS  documentation)](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/concepts/spatialos) .

**Need some help?** Join us at [forums.improbable.io](https://forums.improbable.io) for technical questions and issues.

 **Note**:
SpatialOS 13 is fine for local development and deployments using the `small`
 [deployment template (SpatialOS documentation)](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/reference/file-formats/launch-config#templates), but deployments using larger templates may be unstable.

**License:** See the [license](../LICENSE.md).

### Installing and upgrading
* If you are installing SpatialOS and the SpatialOS Unreal SDK for the first time, see:
[Introduction to the Unreal SDK](introduction.md).
* If you have a version of SpatialOS and the SpatialOS Unreal SDK which is earlier than SpatialOS 13.0,
you have a combined SpatialOS and SpatialOS Unreal SDK bundle. To get the separated version, see
[Upgrading to SpatialOS 13.0 and migrating to the Unreal SDK 1.0.0](migration.md).
